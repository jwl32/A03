## Part 1
Directions on using Microsoft Vistual Studio (explaining VS since I prefer to use it instead of Webstorm):
- Go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
- Scroll down and click on the **Free Download** button for the **Community** version of Visual Studio
- Download the exe and then run it to install Visual Studio
- Open visual studio after the install is complete
- Click the "Create a new project" button to create a new project
- Once the visual studio project is made you can easily turn it into a GitHub repository by clicking the Git dropdown in the top toolbar, and pressing Create Git Repository

## Part 2
Glossary:
- **Branch** - A branch is a parallel version of a repository. Branches act as collections of commits, holding all of a project's pushed changes over time. Branches can be created from other branches, and merged into one another in order to effectively separate and join work done in a project. 
- **Clone** - A clone is a local copy of a remote repository made on a computer. Cloning is also defined as the act of copying a remote repository. 
- **Commit** - A commit is basically a collection of local file changes in a repository that is pushed to the remote repository to store a project's changes over time. 
- **Fetch** - Fetch is used to bring changes from the remote repository to a local repository for review. 
- **GIT** - Git is an open source program used for tracking file changes.
- **Github** - A service that provides hosting for GIT repositories.
- **Merge** - Merging is the act of combining commits from one branch into another branch. 
- **Merge Conflict** - A merge conflict occurs when a user tries to merge one branch into another branch. A merge conflict indicates that one or more file changes differ between the source branch and destination branch during a merge. Merge conflicts must be resolved prior to finalizing a merge. 
- **Push** - Pushing is the act of sending a commit from a local repository to a remote repository.
- **Pull** - Pulling is the act of getting a commit from a remote repository to a local repository. 
- **Remote** - The version of a local repository that is hosted on a server. 
- **Repository** - A workspace that holds a project's files. Repositories are the foundation upon which git is able to sync changes among local and remote versions of a project.
